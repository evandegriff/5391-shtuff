Homework 3 NOTES:

Package dependencies:

matplotlib
sciprog (file found on canvas)
datetime
os
read_dst

IMPORTANT: read_dst is included in the git repo, you must put this file in your python path for the code to run correctly.

to reproduce the plots from my LaTeX file, run the following code from the hw3 directory:

$ python hw3.py
